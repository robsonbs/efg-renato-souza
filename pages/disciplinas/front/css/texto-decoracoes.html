  <h1>Briards</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    The
    <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or
    berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and
    guardian of sheep.

  <h2>Breed History</h2>
  <p>
    The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred
    for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the
    French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers
    because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World
    War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards
    is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and
    Lafayette all owned briards.
